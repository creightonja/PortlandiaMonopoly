# Portlandia Monopoly

##### _Monopoly game based on Portland tech business and local themes_

#### Chris Lytsell, Jason Creighton, Kenny Grage, Aaron Campf.

## Description

_It's Monopoly. Currently a work in progress...the game does not have full monopoly play functionality quite yet. The program was initially an AngularJS class group project at Epicodus for Chris, Jason, and Kenny.
After the project was over, Chris worked with Aaron to move much of the project's JavaScript files to TypeScript. Functionality yet to be completed as of Oct 24, 2015:_
* Exchange money between players (I know, I know, this should have been one of the first items of business)
* Make an auction function for when a player lands on a property but doesn't/can't buy it.
* Mortgage a property
* Develop properties
* Implement a cool visual dice roll
* If above gets done, let players roll to see who goes first
* Probably more stuff/work out bugs

## Setup
```
If you want to open the project in Visual Studio, the project should load up if you open up the _PortlandiaMonopoly.sln_ file in the top level project folder.
```

```
If you want to just play the game, in a console, navigate to the PortlandiaMonopoly folder within the main PortlandiaMonopoly project folder and 
run a python server. Either _python -m http.server [port]_ or _python -m SimpleHTTPServer [port]_ should work, depending on your version of Python.

```

## Technologies Used

_AngularJS, JavaScript, Jquery, CSS_
